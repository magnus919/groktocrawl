## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/compare/v0.10.1...v0.11.0) (2026-06-29)

> _The One That Sees_ — images across the entire stack: scrape, search, crawl, agent, and CLI.

### Highlights

**Scrape extracts structured image metadata.** When `formats` includes `"images"`, the scraper parses every `<img>` tag from the DOM before markdown conversion — capturing `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, and document-order position. Relative URLs are resolved, data URIs can be stripped, and the results land in `ScrapeData.images` alongside the markdown body. Default behavior is unchanged (no images extracted unless requested).

**Image search populates `data.images[]`.** `POST /v2/search` with `sources=["images"]` routes queries to SearXNG image engines and populates the `data.images` slot (previously always empty). A single query can return `data.web` and `data.images` simultaneously when combined sources are requested. The CLI adds `--search-type images` as a convenience shorthand.

**Crawl inherits image extraction.** `POST /v2/crawl` already forwards `scrape_options` (including `formats`) to every page scrape. The CLI now exposes `--format images` on the crawl subcommand so users can request image metadata on every crawled page.

**CLI image display and download.** Search output renders image results as a separate section with title, dimensions, and source URL. Scrape output shows an "Images found on page: N" summary with filename and dimensions. The new `--download-images` flag (scrape and crawl) saves images to `_images/` with concurrent HTTP downloads, content-type validation, HTTP status checking, and filename deduplication.

**Agent learns to gather images.** `--include-images` on the agent command plumbs through the entire research pipeline — from CLI flag → `AgentRequest.include_images` → worker → `run_research` → `_scrape_urls`, which passes `scrape_options={"formats":["markdown","images"]}` to the scraper. Agent-collected images arrive alongside the text synthesis.

### Features

* scrape: `formats=["images"]` extracts `<img>` metadata from DOM ([#370](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/370))
* search: `data.images[]` populated from SearXNG image engines ([#371](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/371))
* CLI: display image results in search and scrape output ([#372](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/372))
* crawl: inherit `formats: images` from scrape via `scrape_options` passthrough ([#373](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/373))
* CLI: `--download-images` flag for scrape and crawl ([#374](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/374))
* agent: `--include-images` CLI flag for image-aware research ([#375](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/375))

### Models & API

* `ImageData` model: `url`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, `position`
* `ImageSearchResult` model: `title`, `image_url`, `image_width`, `image_height`, `url`, `position`
* `ScrapeData.images`: `list[ImageData] | None`
* `AgentRequest.include_images`: `bool` (default `false`)
* `"images"` added to `VALID_SCRAPE_FORMATS`

## [0.10.1](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1) (2026-06-28)

> _The One That Fights Back_ — curl_cffi bypasses Akamai, Playwright stops waiting for Cloudflare challenges that never finish, and the CLI finally speaks API.

### Highlights

**Curl_cffi replaces httpx in the scraper stack.** The fetch tiers now use `curl_cffi.AsyncSession(impersonate="chrome131")` with BoringSSL-based TLS fingerprinting. Sites behind Akamai and Cloudflare edge that previously blocked at TLS handshake time are now reachable by Tiers 1-2. Bundles `libcurl-impersonate-chrome` in the Docker image.

**Tier 2 learned to handle HTML responses.** When a site doesn't return markdown via content negotiation but serves HTML, the scraper now converts it to markdown via readability+markdownify instead of dropping it. This closes a blind spot exposed by the curl_cffi swap: now that Tier 2 can reach Akamai-shielded pages, it was fetching HTML that it couldn't use.

**Cloudflare challenges no longer stall the pipeline.** The Playwright renderer was using `wait_until="networkidle"` which never completes on Cloudflare-protected pages — the JS challenge keeps the network busy indefinitely. The goto would time out at 45s, the scraper would raise, and the pipeline would skip straight to `SCRAPE_FAILED`. Now the scraper loads the challenge page in under a second (`domcontentloaded`), actively polls for the cooldown to clear (checking page title and `cf_clearance` cookie every 2s for up to 30s), and if the challenge persists, gracefully falls through to FlareSolverr instead of returning challenge-HTML garbage as if it were real content. Once through, it waits for the real page to settle before extracting.

**Barrier detection learned to recognize Cloudflare's newer challenge variants.** Pages that hit the "Verification successful. Waiting for turbo.az to respond" or "Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue" screens were previously invisible to the classifier — they passed the quality gate and were returned as "valid" content. Those phrases are now in `CLOUDFLARE_INDICATORS`, so the post-extraction barrier check catches them and routes them correctly.

**CLI now covers every `/v2/` endpoint.** Three new subcommands: `batch-scrape` (job status, cancel, paginated results), `monitor run` (manual trigger), and `parse-upload` (two-step large file upload). A new CI check (`check-cli-coverage.py`) enforces parity on every PR so future API endpoints won't land without CLI counterparts.

### Features

* CLI: `batch-scrape` subcommand with status, cancel, and errors ([#354](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/354))
* API-CLI surface parity: ADR-0039, CI check, and PR template ([#357](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/357))
* CLI: `monitor run` subcommand for manual trigger
* CLI: `parse-upload` subcommand for two-step file upload
* curl_cffi fetch client with Chrome 131 TLS fingerprint impersonation ([#363](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/363))
* Tier 2 HTML-to-markdown fallback via readability+markdownify ([#368](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/368))

### Bug Fixes

* fix: recover `_head_probe` crash from curl_cffi migration
* fix: active Cloudflare challenge polling with domcontentloaded goto strategy ([#369](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/369), closes [#365](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/issues/365))

### CI & Infrastructure

* add check-cli-coverage.py to enforce API-CLI parity in CI

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) (2026-06-27)

> _The One Where the Robot Gets Organized_ — monitors, batch jobs, file uploads, and a CI that doesn't melt.

### Highlights

**Monitors grew up.** You can now trigger a monitor check on demand (`POST /v2/monitor/:id/run`), browse check history (`GET /v2/monitor/:id/checks`), and query individual check results. The monitor system graduated from "fire and forget" to something you can actually debug.

**Batch scraping got real endpoints.** Status polling (`GET /v2/batch/scrape/:id` with pagination), cancellation, and a dedicated errors endpoint. The black box is now a glass box — you can watch a batch scrape unfold, page through results, and see exactly which URLs failed and why.

**Large file parsing, two ways.** The parse endpoint now supports a two-step upload flow: `PUT /v2/parse/upload/:id` to stage a file (up to 3 hours), then reference it via `upload_id` in the parse form. Atomic Lua-scripted get-and-delete means two concurrent parse jobs won't fight over the same upload. Direct multipart upload still works for small files.

**Concurrency, visible.** `GET /v2/concurrency-check` tells you how many jobs are actively processing versus the configured maximum. Useful for tuning before you hammer the API.

**CI stopped lying to us.** The test suite was passing (mostly) but the CI pipeline was a mess of timeouts, OOM kills, deptry tracebacks, and portal tests that hung against a real backend. v0.10.0 ships with Docker-native health checks, a persistent HF model cache volume that doesn't re-download 6.5GB of embeddings on every build, timeouts that actually fit the workload, and a portal test suite that tests the portal (not the agent stack).

### What's Next

The foundation is solid. v0.11.0 targets the observability layer: richer job lifecycle telemetry, structured error classification, and a Prometheus metrics pass across all services.

* add batch scrape status, cancel, and errors endpoints ([#344](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/344))
* add monitor manual trigger endpoint (`POST /v2/monitor/:id/run`) ([#349](https://github.com/groktopus/groktocrawl/pull/349))

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Full crawl engine with Firecrawl v2 feature parity** — replaces the stub `/v2/crawl` endpoint with a full recursive BFS crawl engine. Includes: shared `LinkExtractor` module used by crawl, map, and llmstxt; `CrawlEngine` with configurable concurrency (`maxConcurrency`, `delay`), BFS queue, `max_pages`/`max_depth` enforcement, path filtering (glob and regex with `regexOnFullUrl`), URL dedup with `ignoreQueryParameters`, `crawlEntireDomain`, `allowSubdomains`, `allowExternalLinks`; `SitemapParser` with robots.txt discovery and fallback to common locations; `DedupManager` with canonical tag and SHA-256 content hash dedup; `CrawlCache` with Valkey-backed `maxAge`/`minAge` semantics. New endpoints: `GET /v2/crawl/{id}/errors` (per-URL errors with error types, HTTP status codes, timestamps), `GET /v2/crawl/active` (crawl-specific active job listing), `POST /v2/crawl/params-preview` (NL-to-params preview). Enhanced `CrawlStatusResponse` with `next` pagination, `createdAt`, `completedAt`, `expiresAt`, `duration`, and per-page metadata (title, statusCode, content_type, scraped_at, duration_ms). SSE streaming via `stream: true` with per-page and done events. Per-page webhooks with HMAC signing. NL-to-params via `prompt` field on `CrawlRequest`. Advanced `ScrapeOptions` passthrough (actions, location, proxy, blockAds, parsers). Full test coverage in `tests/test_crawler.py` and expanded integration tests.

### Changed

- **Split `scraper-svc/scraper/fetch.py` (1751 lines → 25 lines)** — extracted 5 focused modules: `cache.py` (Valkey cache client + freshness revalidation), `proxy.py` (httpx + Playwright proxy config), `dns_guard.py` (DNS rebinding + SSRF protection), `barrier.py` (bot challenge detection), and `fetch_strategy.py` (three-tier fetch pipeline). `fetch.py` is now a thin re-export. Updated `politeness.py` and `recovery.py` imports. No behavioral changes, no new dependencies. (closes #188)

- **Consolidated urlparse imports into shared `common/url.py`** — new module with `normalize_url()`, `extract_domain()`, `is_same_origin()`, and `is_private_host()`. Refactored 17+ inline `urlparse` call sites across agent-svc, scraper-svc, and browser-svc. Pure refactor — no behavior changes. Dockerfiles updated with `COPY common/ common/`. 28 new unit tests. (closes #194)

### Added

- **Greenhouse and AshbyHQ ATS adapters** — adds two ATS (Applicant Tracking System) adapters for structured job listing extraction. Greenhouse routes through the `boards-api.greenhouse.io` REST API with readability-lxml + markdownify content conversion. AshbyHQ extracts job data from SSR-embedded `window.__appData` JSON — no API calls needed. Both follow the existing `SiteAdapter` + `@adapter` decorator pattern. See `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/greenhouse.py` and `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/ashbyhq.py`. (closes #206, closes #207)

- **Richer content extraction on `/v2/search` and `/v2/scrape`** — new optional `contents` parameter controls per-result content granularity. Supports verbosity levels (`compact`/`standard`/`full`), section filtering (`include`/`exclude` by category), LLM-extracted highlights and summaries, and extras extraction (links, imageLinks, codeBlocks). Backward compatible — existing behavior unchanged when `contents` is omitted. (closes #328)

- **Search volume controls for agent-svc (ADR-0033)** — two independent mechanisms to prevent runaway Brave API consumption: (1) per-request max-searches cap (`AGENT_MAX_SEARCHES_PER_REQUEST`, default 5) enforced inside `SearXNGClient` before each search call, raises `RateLimitedError` (429) when exceeded; (2) per-client sliding-window rate limit (`AGENT_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT`, default `10/60s`) using Valkey `INCR`/`EXPIRE`. New `X-Search-Budget` and `X-Search-Rate-Remaining` response headers. Search volume observable via new `search_calls_total` metrics counter. Backward compatible — existing callers see 429s only if they exceed limits. No new dependencies. See `docs/adr/0033-search-volume-controls.md`. (closes #213)

- **Project Gutenberg adapter** — extracts books as chapter-structured markdown. Three-tier fallback chain: EPUB → plain text → generic pipeline. Zero new dependencies. Enriches metadata via Gutendex API (title, author, subjects, language). Registered at priority 200. See `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/gutenberg.py`. (closes #181)

- **Batch vector ingestion via Qdrant gRPC (ADR-0030)** — adds `POST /index/batch` to semantic-svc for batched embedding and Qdrant upsert. Batch scrape and crawl workers now accumulate pages and fire a single batch call instead of N per-page calls. Expected: 500-page crawl indexing drops from ~50s to ~250ms (200x). New tests: `test_batch_index_endpoint`, `test_batch_index_empty`. Legacy flat-vector Qdrant collections auto-migrate to named vectors on startup. See `docs/adr/0030-batch-vector-ingestion.md`. (closes #154)

- **Service-level metrics for semantic-svc (ADR-0029)** — adds Prometheus-compatible `/metrics` endpoint to semantic-svc with stdlib-based OpenMetrics format (no new dependencies). Metrics tracked: document count gauge (`groktocrawl_index_docs_total`), eviction counter (`groktocrawl_index_evictions_total`), request latency histogram per endpoint (`groktocrawl_index_query_duration_seconds`), embedding inference duration (`groktocrawl_index_embeddings_duration_seconds`), and request counter per endpoint (`groktocrawl_search_requests_total`). ASGI middleware instruments all 11 existing endpoints automatically. Eviction counter tracks cumulative evictions via `_evict_if_needed()`. See `docs/adr/0029-service-level-metrics-for-semantic-svc.md`. (closes #153)

- **Embedding model migration path — named vectors, backfill, dual-write, cutover (ADR-0028)** — supports upgrading the embedding model without dropping the index. Uses Qdrant named vectors for per-point multi-model storage. New endpoints: `GET /index/model` (model config + migration state), `POST /index/migrate/start` (begin backfill), `GET /index/migrate/status` (progress), `POST /index/migrate/cutover` (switch queries). New payload fields: `embedding_model`, `embedding_dim`, `embedding_models` (history). Dual-write mode indexes with both old and new model during migration. Old vectors retained after cutover for rollback safety. See `docs/adr/0028-embedding-model-migration-path.md`. (closes #155)

- **Unit test coverage for worker.py and research.py** — adds `test_worker.py` (19 tests, 693 lines) covering all 7 worker processing functions, and 23 new tests for previously uncovered research.py functions (`run_extract`, `run_research_stream`, `run_answer_stream`, `run_rich_search`, `_rerank_answer_sources`). Agent-svc/agent coverage from ~15% to 55%. Coverage threshold raised to 20%. (closes #192)

### Fixed

- **Playwright health probe and Tier-3 integration tests** — adds `test_scraper_health_reports_playwright` and `test_scraper_falls_through_to_playwright` to catch missing `playwright install-deps chromium` (fixes #258). Adds `tier3-fixture` service with JS-rendered dynamic content to force Playwright fallback. Scraper `/health` now returns `checks.playwright.available`. (closes #260)

- **Default URL scheme typos in settings** — all four agent-svc default URLs (`scraper_url`, `searxng_url`, `semantic_url`, `llm_base_url`) had `http//` instead of `http://`, causing agent to fail when `.env` didn't explicitly set these. (closes #260)

- **CI workflow fixture setup** — `llm-svc` was not started in the "Start test fixtures" step, breaking the 2 streaming endpoint tests. `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL` now written to `.env` before stack startup so the agent daemon uses the fixture LLM. Semantic-svc health check now validates Qdrant reachability from inside the agent-svc container. (closes #260)

- **Flaky activity feed tests** — `test_activity_shows_active_crawl_job` and `test_activity_multi_type` failed when fast single-page crawls completed before the activity feed check. Both now fall back to the job status endpoint when the job is no longer in the active feed. (closes #260)

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-09

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Two new required services** — `semantic-svc` and `qdrant` are now part of the docker-compose stack. `docker compose up` will fail if these images cannot be pulled. First-time startup requires pulling the Qdrant image, and the semantic-svc needs to create the initial collection — expect a longer first spin-up.
- **New optional service** — `portal-svc` (port 8082:8081) added to docker-compose. Not required for API operation but published by default.
- **Scraper-svc now loads `.env`** — the scraper container has `env_file: .env` in docker-compose.yml. Existing deployments with custom `.env` files will see new env vars picked up automatically.
- **`search_type` defaults to `fast` on `/v2/search`** — this matches existing behavior but is now an explicit parameter. The new `rich` mode is opt-in.

### 🧠 Semantic Search Engine (Phase 1 & 2)

GroktoCrawl evolves from a stateless scraper into a learning search engine with a persistent vector index and ad-hoc semantic reranking.

- **Phase 1: Semantic reranking (#142)** — `semantic-svc` performs embedding-based cosine reranking of SearXNG results on every `/v2/search` call. Uses pure-Python dot product (no numpy dependency, #143). Wired through the `/v2/answer` endpoint via `retrieval_mode` parameter (#156).
- **Phase 2: Persistent vector index with Qdrant (#145)** — every page GroktoCrawl scrapes, crawls, or maps is embedded and stored in a Qdrant vector index (up to 250K docs by default). Subsequent searches query both SearXNG and the local corpus — the project's accumulated knowledge becomes searchable. Qdrant v1.18.2 pinned for reproducibility (#158).
- **Batch vector ingestion via Qdrant gRPC (#163)** — large crawl results are ingested in batches for efficiency. New `semantic-svc/semantic/index.py` module.
- **Content-based near-duplicate detection (#157)** — configurable cosine threshold (default 0.95) identifies duplicates at indexing time. `NEAR_DUP_THRESHOLD` and `NEAR_DUP_MODE` (skip/update) env vars.
- **Smarter index retention — domain TTLs, frequency weighting, access boosting (#159, ADR-0027)** — replaces simple LRU eviction with a scoring function that considers content type, crawl frequency, and access patterns. News/social evicts first; reference/docs content persists longest.
- **Embedding model migration path (#160)** — named vectors support enables future embedding model upgrades with backfill, dual-write during migration, and clean cutover.
- **Service-level metrics for semantic-svc (#161, ADR-0029)** — stdlib-based OpenMetrics: `groktocrawl_index_docs_total`, `groktocrawl_index_evictions_total`, `groktocrawl_index_query_duration_seconds`, `groktocrawl_index_embeddings_duration_seconds`.
- **Thread executor fix (#166)** — `model.encode()` now runs in a thread executor to avoid blocking the async event loop, fixing concurrent request handling under load.
- **Qdrant API compatibility fixes (#146, #165)** — corrects point ID type (uint64 via SHA-256 truncation), uses `using` instead of `query_vector_name` for qdrant-client 1.18 compatibility.

### 🌐 Web Portal (portal-svc)

A human-facing web interface for GroktoCrawl, available at port 8082.

- **Single-search-bar UI (#132, ADR-0021)** — FastAPI + Jinja2 interface with Google-inspired design. Routes queries to `/v2/answer` with SSE streaming, real-time token output with citations, and a recent queries sidebar (localStorage-persisted).
- **Client-side markdown rendering** — uses the `marked` library for full GFM rendering of answer text (tables, bold, inline code, links).
- **Answer-above-sources layout** — primary content displayed first, with scrollable source citations below.
- **Placeholder deep research button** — reserved for future v0.2 integration with agent-SSE.

A new synchronous single-turn Q&A interface sits between `/v2/search` (raw results) and `/v2/agent` (deep multi-step research), giving users a fast grounded-answer path.

- **POST /v2/answer endpoint (#117, ADR-0017)** — pipeline: search → scrape → LLM synthesis → citations in one round-trip. Returns structured response with `answer` (markdown), `sources` (list), `citations` (index↔URL mapping), `search_type`, and `latency_ms`.
- **SSE streaming** — `stream: true` enables token-by-token streaming with source discovery events before LLM output. Reuses protocol from ADR-0017.
- **Concurrent scraping with early sources emission (#135)** — `_scrape_urls()` now scrapes in parallel with semaphore control, emitting sources as they complete instead of waiting for all.
- **Retry on scrape failure (#120)** — loops through search results until enough sources succeed (bounded by 2x requested count). Prevents empty responses when top results are from hostile sites but usable sources exist deeper.
- **Video platform URL deprioritization (#138)** — YouTube, Vimeo, and Twitch URLs are scored lower in source selection, preferring text-based sources.
- **`answer` CLI subcommand (#118)** — `groktocrawl answer "question"` with `--sources`, `--model`, `--num-sources`, and streaming defaults.

### 🔌 New Site Adapters

Building on the adapter framework introduced in v0.6.0, three new adapters add structured extraction for high-value content sources.

- **GitHub adapter (#115)** — `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/github.py` for raw file content, blob URLs, repo roots (README + metadata), and tree listings. Priority 200.
- **GitHub social adapter (#115)** — `scraper-svc/scraper/adapters/github_social.py` for issues, PRs, discussions, releases, and commits via GraphQL API (v4). Three-tier fallback: GraphQL → REST → HTML scrape. Priority 190.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var enables 5,000 req/hr + GraphQL.
  - Works without a token at 60 req/hr (REST) or unauth (HTML scrape).
- **Substack adapter (#122)** — three-tier extraction via RSS feed (primary, no auth) → readability-lxml → browser-svc. Detects both `*.substack.com` and vanity domains via RSS fingerprinting. 26 unit tests.
- **Reddit adapter (#121)** — post and comment extraction via the JSON API (`.json` suffix).

### 🔍 Search Improvements

- **Search type spectrum — fast and rich (#140, ADR-0023)** — `/v2/search` accepts `search_type` (default: `fast`). `fast` is instant (existing behavior). `rich` mode scrapes top results and enriches with LLM synthesis (1-3s). Optional `output_schema` enables structured data extraction in a single call.
- **Agent SSE streaming (#137, ADR-0022)** — `/v2/agent` now supports `stream: true` for Server-Sent Events. Two-phase streaming: discovery events followed by token-by-token LLM output. CLI defaults to streaming; `--sync` to opt out.
- **Vertical search categories (#101, #102)** — `sources` and `categories` parameters on `/v2/search` translated to SearXNG-native categories.

### 🛡️ Politeness Protocol & Proxy Support

- **Politeness protocol (#114)** — new `scraper-svc/scraper/politeness.py` module. Gated behind `SCRAPER_POLITENESS_ENABLED=true`. Fetches and caches robots.txt, enforces Crawl-delay, blocks Disallow paths. 14 unit tests.
- **Proxy support — SCRAPER_PROXY_URL (#129, ADR-0020)** — contributed by @Jackal991. Single env var plumbed through httpx clients and Playwright browser context. Fail-open with WARN on proxy failure.

### 📊 Observability & Operations

- **Health probes and /metrics endpoint (#123, ADR-0018)** — `/health` returns per-dependency probe results. `/metrics` exports counters, histograms, and gauges in OpenMetrics format. Structured JSON logging with request_id correlation.
- **Health endpoint fix (#125)** — corrected `health` → `healthy` state attribute name.

### 🧹 Quality & Cache

- **Intelligent scrape cache — ETag/Last-Modified revalidation (#126, ADR-0019)** — the Valkey-backed cache now uses conditional GETs. 304 responses extend TTL without re-downloading. SHA-256 content hashing detects changes. Per-domain TTLs, configurable bounds, volatility-aware TTL adjustment.
- **Extraction QA pipeline (#111, ADR-0016)** — post-extraction quality gates for boilerplate detection, completeness checks, and block page detection.
- **Graceful degradation (#112)** — `smart_scrape()` degrades through tiers on low-quality content.
- **Structured metadata enrichment (#116, ADR-0004)** — extracts JSON-LD, OpenGraph, Twitter Card, and meta tags alongside markdown.
- **Artifact-pyramid CLI output (#141, ADR-0024)** — `--pyramid` flag on `agent` and `answer` commands.

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Async event loop unblocked (#166)** — synchronous `model.encode()` now runs via thread executor.
- **Qdrant API compatibility (#146, #165)** — uint64 point IDs, `using` keyword for qdrant-client 1.18.
- **Numpy dependency removed (#143)** — pure-Python dot product replaces numpy in semantic reranking.
- **Port exposure cleanup** — semantic-svc port no longer exposed to host.
- **Conditional auth header** — `Authorization: Bearer` only sent when `api_key` is non-empty.
- **ADR cleanup** — stale ADR-0020 removed, proxy ADR renumbered.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Adapter framework** — pluggable site-specific content handlers with auto-registration, priority-sorted dispatch, and per-adapter fallback chains. See `docs/adr/0001`–`0009`.
- **YouTube adapter** — extracts full video transcripts and descriptions via `youtube_transcript_api` (free, no key). Returns YAML frontmatter (title, channel, views) + description + transcript as markdown.
- **Bluesky adapter** — extracts posts and threads via the AT Protocol public API (no auth required). Returns YAML frontmatter (author, handle, engagement stats) + post text with richtext facet conversion (mentions, links, tags) + depth-1 replies as markdown.
- **Barrier classification (Phase 1)** — `_classify_barrier()` replaces the boolean `_looks_suspicious()` heuristic. Detects Cloudflare, DDoS-Guard, CAPTCHA, rate-limit, Substack redirect, and empty-content barriers with confidence scoring. ADR-0015.
- **Valkey scrape result cache** — TTL-based cache (default: 1 hour) for scrape results. Configurable via `SCRAPE_CACHE_TTL` env var. Adapter results excluded from cache.
- **Search failure detection** — `SearchHealth` dataclass reports per-query engine status (total engines, responding engines, degraded vs empty-result signal).
- **Firecrawl v2 category translation** — `sources` and `categories` parameters on `/v2/search` are translated to SearXNG-native categories. `sources=news` → `categories=news`, `categories=research` → `categories=science`, etc. CLI exposes `--sources` and `--categories` flags.
- **Architecture-as-code** — C4 system-context and container diagrams in `docs/architecture.md`. GitHub Actions CI workflow validates ADR naming, required sections, and index freshness.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs 0001–0015)** — covers adapter framework, scraper pipeline, stealth Playwright, webhooks, search architecture, binary content, barrier classification.

### Changed

- `smart_scrape()` now: (1) checks adapter registry, (2) checks Valkey cache, (3) runs barrier classification after each tier, (4) runs the existing 5-tier pipeline.
- `/v2/search` response routes results to the correct top-level key (`data.web`, `data.news`, `data.images`) based on the `sources` filter.
- `SearchRequest` model now accepts `sources: list[str] | None`.
- CLI search subcommand now accepts `--sources` (web, news, images, video, social) and `--categories` (research, github, pdf, etc.).

### Documentation

- Architecture Decision Records: 15 total (was 9).
- `docs/architecture.md` — C4 System Context and Container diagrams.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — ADR convention section.
- `AGENTS.md` — search parameters documentation for AI agents.
- `README.md` — Search endpoint docs with parameter and translation tables, detailed Adapters section (YouTube + Bluesky).
- `.env.sample` — added `SCRAPE_CACHE_TTL`, `ADAPTER_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.

### Infrastructure

- `.github/workflows/architecture.yml` — CI pipeline validating ADR structure on push/PR to main.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-31

### Security

- **API key authentication** — Set `API_KEY` in `.env` to enable bearer token auth. All endpoints (except `/health`) require `Authorization: Bearer` or `X-API-Key`. When unset, a startup warning is logged, an `X-Security-Warning` header is added to every response, the `/health` endpoint includes a structured `security` field, and the CLI prints a one-time stderr warning. Backward compatible — existing deployments work unchanged. (#83)
- **Private IP / SSRF protection** — Both `browser-svc` and `scraper-svc` now validate destination URLs before navigation. RFC 1918 private ranges, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), and Docker host suffixes (`.docker.internal`) are blocked with a 400 error. Hostnames are resolved to IPs and checked, preventing DNS rebinding attacks. (#83)
- **Port hardening** — Removed host port exposure from `browser-svc` (8012), `scraper-svc` (8001), and `parse-svc` (8013). These services are only reachable on Docker's internal DNS. The agent API on port 8080 remains the sole external entry point. (#83)

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `browser-svc`, `scraper-svc`, and `parse-svc` no longer publish host ports. Scripts or tools that connect directly to these services on ports 8012, 8001, or 8013 must be updated to go through the agent API on port 8080. (#83)
- **Breaking**: Existing `.env` files that manually set `SCRAPER_URL=http://localhost:8001` will break. Change to `http://scraper-svc:8001` (Docker internal DNS). (#83)
- `docker-compose.yml` restructured — internal services no longer expose ports. (#83)

### Added

- New `agent-svc/agent/auth.py` — centralized authentication module with `verify_api_key()` FastAPI dependency. (#83)
- `SECURITY.md` — security policy, supported versions, and disclosure acknowledgments. (#83)

### Credits

This release was prompted by a responsible disclosure from **Bertie**, who
privately reported the unauthenticated browser pivot vulnerability. Thank you.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **CLI subcommands for monitor, parse, and generate-llmstxt** (`groktocrawl` binary) — three new entry points for managing change monitors (create/list/get/update/delete), parsing document files (PDF, EPUB, DOCX) to markdown, and generating llms.txt for a website with async polling. (#79, #81)
- **Agent system prompt upgrade** (`agent-svc/agent/research.py`) — replaced the minimal 7-line `SYSTEM_PROMPT` with a comprehensive prompt that instructs the LLM to evaluate source quality, synthesize across multiple pages, detect contradictions, flag thin evidence, and cite sources by URL. The new prompt defines a clear source authority ladder (official docs > established news > blogs/forums) and tells the agent to be thorough and precise rather than just "concise."
- **Extract prompt upgrade** — `EXTRACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` now instructs the LLM to extract ALL instances of requested data, flag missing/ambiguous values, and organize output clearly.
- **Model selection passthrough** — the `model` field from `POST /v2/agent` requests is now respected. When set to a specific model name (e.g., `"gpt-4o"`) it overrides the environment-configured default.
- **Domain metadata in context** — each scraped source now includes `(domain: example.com)` in the context passed to the LLM.

### Changed

- **Search results format** — `/v2/search` now returns results grouped by source type per Firecrawl v2 spec (`{"data": {"web": [...]}}`) instead of a flat array. (#66)

### Fixed

- **50x search speedup** — removed redundant per-result scraping from `/v2/search`. (#69)
- **Search CLI parsing** — `groktocrawl search` correctly reads from `data.web` dict instead of the flat `data` list. (#71)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

#### Substack Scraping (Stealth Playwright Config)

- **Stealth Playwright renderer** (`scraper-svc/scraper/stealth.py`) — the scraper-svc's Tier 3 now launches Chromium with `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, a real Chrome 131 User-Agent, 1920x1080 viewport, `en-US` locale, `America/New_York` timezone, and `navigator.webdriver` override via `add_init_script()`.
- **SPA content retry** — when extracted markdown is short (< 500 chars) or suspicious, the scraper scrolls to the bottom of the page and waits up to 6s to trigger lazy-loaded content.
- **Substack redirect detection** — `_is_substack_redirect()` detects `session-attribution-frame`, `channel-frame`, and GTM noscript redirects.
- **Content gate fix** — `smart_scrape()` now returns extracted content immediately when `_looks_suspicious()` passes, even if embedded content signals are present.

#### Cookie Persistence (scraper-svc)

- **Valkey-backed Cloudflare cookie store** — `cf_clearance` cookies are cached and reused across scrapes via Valkey (25-minute TTL, TLD+1 domain scoping).
- **Cookie injection before navigation** — `fetch_via_playwright()` injects stored `cf_clearance` cookies before navigating.

### Changed

- **Browser args stripped** — removed `--disable-web-security`, `--disable-features=IsolateOrigins,site-per-process`, and `--disable-features=BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests` from the stealth config.

### Fixed

- **False-positive embedded content detection** — `substackcdn.com` was falsely matching the `cdn.` domain pattern. Fixed by prioritizing `content_good` over embedded content signals.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-24

### Added

#### Five-Tier Scrape Pipeline

- **Tier 3.5: FlareSolverr** — optional profile-gated container for hard Cloudflare challenges.
- **Tier 4: LLM-Assisted Recovery** — when standard tiers return suspicious content, the scraper calls a configured LLM to analyze the page.
- **Tier 5: LLM Cloudflare Classification** — when all bypass methods fail, the LLM explains the block type and suggests alternative access paths.

#### Binary Content Support

- **Content-Type detection** — auto-detects PDF, EPUB, images, and archives at the HTTP tier. Returns a structured `download` payload.
- **`groktocrawl download <url>`** — new CLI subcommand for binary content.

### Infrastructure

- **Contribution templates**: added bug report and feature request issue templates, PR template, updated `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Unified activity endpoint** (`GET /v2/activity`) — lists all active jobs across all job types.
- **Lightweight meta tag extraction** (`POST /scrape/meta`) — single HTTP GET to extract `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<meta property="og:description">`.
- **Sentence-boundary-aware description extraction** — llms.txt generator produces descriptions ending at complete sentence boundaries.

### Fixed

- CLI `active` command (no longer returns 404).
- llms.txt descriptions no longer truncated mid-sentence or include boilerplate.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-21
